  annote = {This article covers the history of quantum mechanical models. The time ranges from 1910 to "present day" under the time of Pople writing this article (1999). The ariticle starts with a general overivew of common quantum chemistry principles to give the reader an overview. This overview helps the reader better understand the more complex concepts later in the article. To finish the article, Pople explains the future improvement of certain models.},
